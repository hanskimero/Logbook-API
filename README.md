# Learning project on APIs and Prisma ORM

This is a learning project: a REST API to log drive kilometers. In addition to
express, I've used Prisma ORM for the datamodel with Sqlite as the provider. An errorhandler and a separate statusHandler are also included.

## Technologies:

Express, Typescript, Prisma ORM, Sqlite.

## Test functionality:

Test with Postman in <i>http://localhost:3104/api/log<i>
